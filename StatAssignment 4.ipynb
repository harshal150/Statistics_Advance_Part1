    "Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are two concepts in probability theory used to describe the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Probability Mass Function (PMF) is a function that gives the probability of a discrete random variable taking on each possible value. In other words, it assigns probabilities to each possible outcome of a discrete random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we are rolling a fair six-sided die. The possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The PMF would be a function that assigns a probability to each of these outcomes. Since the die is fair, the probability of rolling any one of these outcomes is 1/6. So the PMF would be:\n",

    "P(X=1) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X=2) = 1/6\n",

    "P(X=5) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X=6) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "A Probability Density Function (PDF), on the other hand, is a function that describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. It gives the relative likelihood of the random variable taking on a particular value.\n",
    "For example, let's say we are measuring the height of a group of people. The heights are continuous and can take on any value within a certain range. The PDF would be a function that describes the relative likelihood of measuring a particular height.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF of a continuous random variable is defined such that the area under the curve between any two points gives the probability that the random variable takes on a value within that range. For example, if the PDF is a normal distribution with a mean of 5 feet and a standard deviation of 1 foot, the probability of measuring a height between 4 feet and 6 feet would be the area under the curve between those two points.\n",

    "The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a function that describes the probability that a continuous random variable X takes on a value less than or equal to x. It is denoted by F(x).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the CDF is the integral of the Probability Density Function (PDF) of X from negative infinity to x. Mathematically, it is defined as:\n",
    "$ F(x) = P(X <= x) = ∫(-∞,x) f(t) dt$\n",

    "\n",
    "where f(t) is the PDF of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF is a non-decreasing function, meaning that as x increases, the probability that X takes on a value less than or equal to x also increases. Additionally, the CDF is a continuous function, except at points where the PDF has a discontinuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have a random variable X that is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. The PDF of X is a constant 1 between 0 and 1, and 0 elsewhere. The CDF of X would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$F(x) = P(X <= x) = ∫(0,x) 1 dt = x, for 0 <= x <= 1$<br> $F(x) = 0, for x < 0$<br> $F(x) = 1, for x > 1$<br>\n",
    "\n",

    "We can use the CDF to find probabilities for X. For example, the probability that X is between 0.2 and 0.8 is:\n",
    "$P(0.2 < X < 0.8) = F(0.8) - F(0.2) = 0.8 - 0.2 = 0.6$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF is useful because it allows us to calculate probabilities for continuous random variables without having to integrate the PDF. Additionally, it provides a convenient way to compare the distributions of different random variables. By comparing the CDFs of two random variables, we can see which one has a greater probability of taking on a certain value, or which one has a greater spread of values."

The Bernoulli distribution is named after the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli.\n",

    "The Bernoulli distribution is the simplest probability distribution for a binary outcome.

This leads us to the binomial distribution.\n",

    "The main difference between the Bernoulli distribution and the binomial distribution is that the Bernoulli distribution models a single binary outcome, while the binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
